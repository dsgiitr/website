Our member [Vipul Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipul-bansal-b8183b17a/) was involved in building a AI based prediction model using Chest X-Rays.

The pre-print version of the paper for the research can be found here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.13.20063461v1

The work received media attention which can be found [here](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-scientists-devise-low-cost-ai-based-software-to-detect-covid-19/articleshow/75187192.cms)
