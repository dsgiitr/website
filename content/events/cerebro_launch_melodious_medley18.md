Greetings IITR!

Hold your breath as a new era of DS in IIT Roorkee begins. Tonight, we launch [CEREBRO](http://cerebro.sdslabs.co/), a platform for hosting data hackathons exclusively in IITR developed by SDSLabs. Along with it, SDSLabs and DSG is launching ‘MELODIOUS MEDLEY’, a 4-day competition on predictive modeling, open for all years. Participate and grab this opportunity to be a part of our team. The top performers in the final evaluation will get a direct entry to the interview round of DSG Recruitments.
