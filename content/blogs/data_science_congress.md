I know. You know. Everybody knows. What?

> **India. Research. Data Science. They hardly go together.**

In such a scenario, finding a place where there’s a good _intermix_ of World-class Professionals with astounding backgrounds and **open** platforms for discussion is tough. Very tough.

### A confluence of Analytics, Big Data, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, IoT and Cognitive Computing.

This is what [**DSC**](http://datasciencecongress.com/) website says. As far as I am concerned, it’s the _must-attend_ event for any Data Science or ML Enthusiast. Whether you are a Beginner, or Advanced, I can bet you won’t regret being a part of this!

If you don’t agree already, read till the end. You’ll be packing bags for Mumbai after that.

# When? Where? Who? Why?

- 5th to 8th June 2017

- Organised by [**Aegis School of Data Science**](http://www.aegis.edu.in/)

- To spread the culture of DS by exploring latest tools, methods and best of the best practices.

# Segments

Being the country’s largest Data science meet, it caters to impress the audience with a variety of approaches. From **Key Notes** to _Research Paper presentations_, from **Technology exhibition** to _Idea propagation_, DSC has all the bases covered in desirable proportions.

For anyone beginning Data Science or wanting to explore, there can be nothing better than active participation in DSC’17!

### A hard beginning maketh a good ending. - John Heywood

This post talks about the great keynote speeches and talks lined up for the event. Just try and appreciate the diversity that shall be covered within a span of 3–4 days. Commendable effort by the organisers!
To put things in perspective, the entire panel consists of 54 speakers belonging to different countries, ethnicities and professional pasts. Without exposure to Industry and actual market conditions, excelling in any field is strenuous.

#### The entire list of keynotes can be divided into various domains to illustrate the sundry nature of guests. Namely:

- Academia

- Artificial Intelligence and IoT

- Analytics

- Banking

- Consultancy

- Finance

- Government

- Healthcare

- Information Technology

- Research

- Security

- Telecommunication

- Others like Sports, Gaming, Logistics, Travel, Education, Fashion and Manufacturing

For detailed coverage of every speaker in other domains, keep following this space.

Other aspects of the Congress i.e. workshops and start-up pitches shall be discussed after the keynote description!

P.S. - This is my personal division and opinion of DSC’17. :)
Do try and be a part for your own benefit. DS Community needs opportunities like these for extensive knowledge.

_And, ❤ if this was a good read. Enjoy!_
