## Q Learning Agent to Play 2048

Implementation of deep Q-network to play the game 2048 using Keras.

### Project Description

For calculating the Q Values we used a Neural Network, rather than just showing the current state to the network, the next 4 possible states(left, right, up, down) were also shown. This intuition was inspired from Monte Carlo Tree Search where game is played till the end to determine the Q-Values. For data preprocessing log2 normalisation, training was done using the Bellman's Equation. The policy used was Epsilon greedy, to allow exploration the value of epsilon was annealed down by 5%.
